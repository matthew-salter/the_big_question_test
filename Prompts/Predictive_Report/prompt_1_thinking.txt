You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to create a structured, data-driven report in response to a key client question.  
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to identify the primary influencing factors and their projected effects.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{client}

**CLIENT CONTEXT**  
{client_context}

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{main_question}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**

### OBJECTIVE
You must:
**[1] Top-Level Section Identification**:
- Identify exactly {number_sections} distinct sections (no fewer) influencing {target_variable} of {commodity} in {region} over the next {time_range}.
- Each section must include:
  - A Section Title
  - A Section Makeup (% contribution to the overall change) — must sum to exactly 100% across all sections, using integer values only.
  - A Section Change (%) — calculated **strictly and only** as the **sum total of all Sub-Section Effects** within that section.
  - A Section Effect (%) — calculated as: **Section Effect = Section Change × Section Makeup**
    - All values must respect signs and decimal rules:
      - Section Makeup: integers only, must sum to 100
      - Section Change: float with 1 decimal place only, derived strictly by summing Sub-Section Effects
      - Section Effect: float with 1 decimal place only, derived from formula above

**[2] Sub-Sections per Section**:
- Within each section, identify exactly {number_sub_sections} sub-sections (no fewer) that influence it.
- Each sub-section must include:
  - A Sub-Section Title
  - A Sub-Section Makeup (%) — must sum to exactly 100% per section, using integer values only.
  - A Sub-Section Change (%) — strictly directional, to 1 decimal place:
    - Use a negative value if pressure is downward on {target_variable}
    - Use a positive value if pressure is upward on {target_variable}
    - Do not invert or reinterpret direction
  - A Sub-Section Effect (%) — calculated as: **Sub-Section Effect = Sub-Section Change × Sub-Section Makeup**
    - Must be a float with 1 decimal place only

**[3] Section-Level Maths Enforcement (Strict)**:
- You must calculate values using this exact dependency chain:
  1. Sub-Section Effect = Sub-Section Change × Sub-Section Makeup
  2. Section Change = **Sum of all Sub-Section Effects in this section**
  3. Section Effect = Section Change × Section Makeup
- You may **not**:
  - Use averages, weights, or reasoning to derive Section Change
  - Derive Section Change from Sub-Section Changes
  - Override or adjust signs, magnitudes, or values based on interpretation
  - Round intermediate calculations (only round final values to 1 decimal place)
  - Skip any decimal, sign, or format conventions
- If `Section Change ≠ exact sum of Sub-Section Effects`, your output is invalid.
- If `Section Effect ≠ Section Change × Section Makeup`, your output is invalid.

**[4] MATHS VALIDATION OVERRIDE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- The model must verify all mathematical relationships prior to output.
- Section Change must be calculated as: **Section Change = Sub-Section Effect 1 + Sub-Section Effect 2 + Sub-Section Effect 3**
- Section Effect must be calculated as: **Section Effect = Section Change × Section Makeup**
- If Section Change ≠ exact sum of Sub-Section Effects, the entire JSON is invalid and must not be output.
- If Section Effect ≠ Section Change × Section Makeup, the output is invalid and must not be output.
- You must perform this check before outputting the final JSON.
- You must use the actual values already generated above — do not estimate, interpret, or re-enter these values manually.
- If a mistake is detected, you must halt, recalculate, and regenerate the correct values before output.

**[5] Sources**:
- For each Section and each Sub-Section, use multiple supporting articles where available.
- Select and name one most relevant or representative article per Section and per Sub-Section, strictly published within the last {reference_age_range}, and no later than {today_date}.
- Articles older than the allowed range must not be used.

---

### RULES: 
- Today's date is {today_date}.
- All reference sourcing related articles:
  - Be strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later) of {today_date}.
  - Be credible and relevant
  - Support reasoning (not dictate percentages)
  - Include:
    - `Title` 
    - `Date` 
    - `Summary` 
    - `Relevance` 
    - `Source` (no URLs)  
- If no source exists, use `"Unknown"`
