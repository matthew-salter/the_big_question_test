You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to create a structured, data-driven report in response to a key client question.  
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to identify the primary influencing factors and their projected effects.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{client}

**CLIENT CONTEXT**  
{client_context}

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{main_question}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**  
{question_context}

### OBJECTIVE
You must:
**[1] Top-Level Section Identification**:
- Identify exactly {number_sections} distinct sections (no fewer) influencing {target_variable} of {commodity} in {region} over the next {time_range}.
- Each section must include:
  - A `Section Title`
  - A `Section Makeup` — the percentage contribution of this section to the overall projected change.
    - **MakeUp % must be justified by the *degree of influence* and *evidence strength*** based on current trends, article support, and structural relevance to the target variable.
    - All values must be **integers only**, and must **sum to exactly 100% across all sections**.

**[2] Sub-Sections per Section**:
- Within each section, identify exactly {number_sub_sections} sub-sections (no fewer) that influence it.
- Each sub-section must include:
  - A `Sub-Section Title`
  - A `Sub-Section Makeup` — the percentage contribution of this sub-section to its parent section.
    - Do **not default to templates** (e.g. 34/33/33). 
    - Each Makeup % must reflect the *relative strength of influence* and *article evidence*.
    - Must use **integers only**, and **sum to exactly 100% per section**.
  - A `Sub-Section Change` — strictly directional, to 1 decimal place:
    - You **must provide a change percentage** (e.g. it must never be 0%). 
    - Use a negative value if pressure is downward on {target_variable}
    - Use a positive value if pressure is upward on {target_variable}
    - Do not invert or reinterpret direction.

**[3] Sources**:
- For each Section and each Sub-Section, use multiple supporting articles where available.
- Select and name one most relevant or representative article per Section and per Sub-Section, strictly published within the last {reference_age_range}, and no later than {today_date}.
- Articles older than the allowed range must not be used.

---

### RULES: 
- Today's date is {today_date}.
- All reference sourcing related articles:
  - Be strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later) of {today_date}.
  - Be credible and relevant
  - Support reasoning (not dictate percentages)
  - Include:
    - `Title` 
    - `Date` 
    - `Summary` 
    - `Relevance` 
    - `Source` (no URLs)  
-
