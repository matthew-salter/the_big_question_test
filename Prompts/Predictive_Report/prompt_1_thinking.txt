### OBJECTIVE
You must:
**[1] Top-Level Section Identification**:
- Identify exactly {number_sections} distinct sections (no fewer) influencing {target_variable} of {commodity} in {region} over the next {time_range}.
- Each section must include:
  - A Section Title
  - A Section Makeup (% contribution to the overall change) — must sum to exactly 100% across all sections, using integer values only.
    - All values must respect signs and decimal rules:
      - Integers only, must sum to 100

**[2] Sub-Sections per Section**:
- Within each section, identify exactly {number_sub_sections} sub-sections (no fewer) that influence it.
- Each sub-section must include:
  - A Sub-Section Title
  - A Sub-Section Makeup (%) — must sum to exactly 100% per section, using integer values only.
  - A Sub-Section Change (%) — strictly directional, to 1 decimal place:
    - Use a negative value if pressure is downward on {target_variable}
    - Use a positive value if pressure is upward on {target_variable}
    - Do not invert or reinterpret direction

**[3] Sources**:
- For each Section and each Sub-Section, use multiple supporting articles where available.
- Select and name one most relevant or representative article per Section and per Sub-Section, strictly published within the last {reference_age_range}, and no later than {today_date}.
- Articles older than the allowed range must not be used.

### RULES: 
- Today's date is {today_date}.
- All reference sourcing related articles:
  - Be strictly published within the last {reference_age_range} (absolutely no later) of {today_date}.

  - Include:
    - `Title` 
    - `Date` 
    - `Summary`
