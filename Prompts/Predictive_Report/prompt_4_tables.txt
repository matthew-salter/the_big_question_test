You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are helping to generate structured table data based on structured data previously identified.
Use your understanding of the client context, the main question, and the main question content to help generate the table data.

**CLIENT NAME**  
{client}

**CLIENT CONTEXT**  
{client_context}

**MAIN QUESTION**  
{main_question}

**QUESTION CONTEXT**  
{question_context}

**SECTION STRUCTURE**  
The following JSON structure contains all the sections and sub-sections structure:    
{prompt_1_thinking}

### OBJECTIVE
You must:
- Follow the below structure to generate structured Report Table & Section Table data sets.

- For the Report Change:
  - Sum total all the **Section Effect** values to calculate the **Report Change**.
  - **Do not reinterpret the direction, magnitude, or sign of these values. Always follow the exact calculations defined above.**
  - The **Report Change** valuev must strictly be to **1 decimal place**  
  
- For the Report table:
  - Create the **Report Change Title** as "{target_variable} of {commodity} in the {region} over the next {time_range}."
  - List the **Report Change** value (as calculated above, e.g. +8.0)
  - List in table format; 
    - Each of the **Section Title**, **Section Makeup**, **Section Change** and **Section Effect** values.
    - Each of the **Section Title** in the first column.
    - Each of the corresponding **Section Makeup** values in the second column. (e.g. 40%)
    - Each of the corresponding **Section Change** values in the third column. (e.g. +2.5%)
    - Each of the corresponding **Section Effect** values in the fourth column. (e.g. +1.0%)
    - Sort order the table with the highest **Section Makeup** fists, followed by the highest **Section Change** value second, followed by the highest **Section Effect** value third.

- For each of the Section Tables:
  - List in table format; 
    - Each of the **Sub-Section Title**, **Sub-Section Makeup**, **Sub-Section Change** and **Sub-Section Effect** values.
    - Each of the **Sub-Section Title** in the first column.
    - Each of the corresponding **Sub-Section Makeup** values in the second column. (e.g. 60%)
    - Each of the corresponding **Sub-Section Change** values in the third column. (e.g. +3.5%)
    - Each of the corresponding **Sub-Section Effect** values in the fourth column. (e.g. +2.1%)
    - Sort order the table with the highest **Sub-Section Makeup** fists, followed by the highest **Sub-Section Change** value second, followed by the highest **Sub-Section Effect** value third.

### RULES

- Do not generate new calculations. Use exact values already provided.
