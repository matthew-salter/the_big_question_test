You must return valid, uninterrupted JSON with no commentary, explanation, or content references. Do not truncate or substitute. Output the full JSON exactly as structured.

### INSTRUCTION & CONTEXT
You are required to analyse and forecast the price impact on a commodity based on attached supply and demand reports, using provided elasticity formulas and assumptions.

**COMMODITY**  
{commodity}

**REPORT DATE**
{report_date}

**TIME FRAME**
{time_range}

**REGION**
{region}

**SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS**  
*IMPORTANT*: Your primary objective is to achieve the defined objective. Use the attached documents as **strong** reference materials — they should significantly inform your reasoning where relevant.

**SUPPLY FORECAST PERCENTAGE**  
{supply_percentage}

**DEMAND FORECAST PERCENTAGE**  
{demand_percentage}

---

### OBJECTIVE  
Please read and evaluate the attached supply and demand reports.
Based on the attached supply & demand reports for {commodity}, and based on the supply forecast percentage of {supply_percentage}, and based on the demand forecast percentage of {demand_percentage}, and using the following elasticity-based formula:

Expected Price Change (%) = (Demand% Change - Supply% Change) / (Supply Elasticity + |Demand Elasticity|)

**Definitions**:
- Supply% Change: Percentage change in supply {supply_percentage}
- Demand% Change: Percentage change in demand {demand_percentage}
- Supply Elasticity (Es): Sensitivity of quantity supplied to price changes.
- Demand Elasticity (Ed): Sensitivity of quantity demanded to price changes.

Estimate the overall likely impact on Industrial Frozen Chicken Breast price changes. Assume typical elasticity conditions based on the commodity type.

**Elasticity Conditions Example**:
- Typical elasticity conditions example: Agricultural commodities
- - Supply elasticity (Es): 0.4
- - Demand elasticity (Ed): -0.3

- Typical elasticity conditions example: Industrial commodities
- - Supply elasticity (Es): 0.8
- - Demand elasticity (Ed): -0.5
